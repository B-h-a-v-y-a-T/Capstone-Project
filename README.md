# Capstone Project on Real-Time Dynamic Pricing Models for Smart Urban Parking

A predictive analytics project designed to optimize urban parking through real-time dynamic pricing based on demand factors like occupancy, traffic, queue length, and special events. The project models multiple pricing strategies (Model 1 and Model 2), integrates real-time data simulation, and compares models via interactive visual dashboards.

## Project Models

### ðŸ”¹ Model 1: Simple Linear Pricing
- Price is a linear function of occupancy
- Price<sub>(t+1)</sub> = Price<sub>(t)</sub> + Î± * Occupancy
- `Î±` estimated using real-time patterns 
- Real-time visualization per parking spot

### ðŸ”¹ Model 2: Feature-Based Demand Pricing
- Uses multiple features:  
  `Occupancy`, `QueueLength`, `Traffic`, `SpecialDay`, `VehicleType`
- Simulates prices based on assumed coefficients
- Recovers coefficients using regression to validate model
- More dynamic and granular control over price sensitivity

### ðŸ”¹ Model Comparison
- Unified dashboard for comparing pricing logic across all 14 parking spots
- Performance and sensitivity of each model visible in real-time

## Workflow & Pipeline

1. **Simulated Data Source**: CSV files continuously updated to mimic live parking spot data.
2. **Pathway Integration**: Processes data streams in real time using delta windows.
3. **Model 1**: Trains a simple linear model per parking spot using occupancy.
4. **Model 2**: Uses richer features with assumed coefficients to simulate price, then regresses back to estimate those coefficients.
5. **Visualization**: Each model's pricing for all 14 spots is visualized live using Bokeh and Panel.
6. **Model Comparison**: A notebook and dashboard compare results between Model 1 and 2 under identical scenarios.

## How to Run

1. Open notebooks in Google Colab or JupyterLab.
2. Ensure required packages are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pathway bokeh pandas panel
   ```
3. Run the Model 1 and Model 2 notebooks to see real-time pricing output.
4. Use the Comparison Notebook to view differences and performance of both models.
